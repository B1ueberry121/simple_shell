# Holberton Simple Shell

This is a shell system created in order to perform basic shell operations, as such it is capable of taking lines of characters from standard input and processing them into commands and arguments which will then be executed by the shell. It was constructed to work in a similiar manner to the /bash/sh program, in that it will run a shell within an existing shell.

The holberton shell comes pre-compiled, but all necessary source code files are present should you need to compile it yourself. It adheres to betty formatting standards of course. The shell can be use through running the hsh executable; refer to the man page for built ins.
